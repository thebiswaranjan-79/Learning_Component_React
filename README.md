##  Render and Commit 
=> This is a a3 step Process 
-> Triggering = It somehow tries to trigger re render  
-> Rendering = there is 2 type of render - initial render and re render 
                        initial render -> react cals the root components 
                        re- render -> react only calls the components 
-> Commiting = Commit phase updates the UI
